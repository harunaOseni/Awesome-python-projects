NOTES ON THE FLASK FRAMEWORK 

# Flask is a microframework for Python. 
It is a thin layer on top of the Python standard library, which helps in running up 
a server and making web applications.

# if __name__ == “__main__” is the part of the program that runs when the 
script is run from the command line using a command like python File1.py.

# App routing is used to map the specific URL with the associated function that is 
intended to perform some task. It is used to access some particular page

# By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and 
extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it

# Syntactic sugar is a syntax that allow developers to write code easier.
